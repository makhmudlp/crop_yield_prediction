# Machine Learning Regression for Crop Yield Prediction

This repository contains the code used in the study:

> **Machine Learning Regression for Crop Yield Prediction Using Soil and Environmental Features**

The project explores multiple machine-learning regression models for predicting crop yield from soil nutrients, nutrient ratios and environmental variables, and compares a **full feature set** with a **reduced core feature set** (Temperature, Rainfall, N\_Ratio, P\_Ratio, K\_Ratio). Model interpretability is analyzed using **SHAP**.

The repo currently consists of a single Jupyter notebook that implements the full experimental pipeline.
